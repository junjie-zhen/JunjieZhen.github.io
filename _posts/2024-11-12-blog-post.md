The ginkgo tree in the ancient Guanyin Temple is located at the foot of Qinling Mountain in Xi'an, which was planted by Emperor Li Shimin of the Tang Dynasty. According to legend, the King of the Jinghe Dragon violated the laws of heaven and was beheaded by Wei Zheng, a vassal of the Tang Dynasty, in a dream, so the spirit of resentment dreamed to the Tang Dynasty to claim his life, and the Emperor was frightened and suffered from ailments, and then he prayed to the Goddess of Mercy, the Goddess of Mercy, for a supernomination of the King of Dragons, and he constructed the Guanyin Temple, and planted the ginkgo tree by hand for a period of more than 1,400 years.<br/><img src='/images/13.jpg'>
