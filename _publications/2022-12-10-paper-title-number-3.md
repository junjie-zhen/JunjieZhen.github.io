Abstract: In order to understand the current situation of water resourcesutilization in Shaanxi Province and promote the efficient use of waterresources and sustaimable development of water resources, a comprehensive utilization model of water resources in Shaanxi Province was bulbased on the adaptability of water resources caurying capacity and water resources management resilience and elasticity. The comprehensive utilization level of water resources in the province from 2013 to 2020 was measured, and the evolution trend in a certain period of time in thefuture was predicted. The results show that; the comprehensive utilizaion level of water resources in Shanxi Province has the characteristicsof obvious diferences and oscilating decline, and generaly shows a dynamic evolution proces of frst decine and then improvement, andthere is a trend of polarization; the overal utilizaion level of water resources in Shaanxi Province presents conditions convergence characteristics, adjacent areas at the same level will further strengthen the path dependence of low-level and low-level areas ;with the improvement ofthe comprehensive utilization of water resources in adiacent areas, the probability of transition in low-level areas increases, showing a significant demonstration and drive effect.
