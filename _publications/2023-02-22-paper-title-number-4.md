Abstract: With the vigorous development and full penetration of the new generation of digital information technology, the paradigm of innovation has changed, The emergence of digital innovation provides new impetus and opportunity for reshaping the current innovative economic systemand deepening the high quality economic development under the background of the digital economy. From the perspective of synergy theory, this paper theoretically explores the synergy mechanismbetween digital innovation and highquality economic development, and further uses the provinciapanel data from 2013 to 2019 to build a duaFsystem coupling coordination model of "digital innovation high quality economic development", and empirically tests the synergy effect and dynamic evolution of digital innovation and highquality economic development in China, It is found that; First,the matching degree between digital innovation and highrquality economic development determinesthe quality of economic development, There is a close relationship between digital innovation andhigh-quality economic development in most provinces of China, and there is a high matching degreebetween them, Second, the integration of digital innovation and highquality economic developmentdetermines the synergy effect of highquality economic development, Most of China's digital innovation and highrquality economic development is in a moderate or mild imbalance. The fundamentalreason for the longterm imbalance between regional digital innovation and high-quality economicdevelopment lies in the fact that digital innovation lags behind highquality economic developmentfor a long time. Third, there is significant regional heterogeneity in the synergy between digital in-novation and highrquality economic development in various regions of China, From the perspectiveof spatial location, it is found that the synergy between digital innovation and high quality economicdevelopment has the spatial spillover effects of "being good neighbors" and "begging neighbors"This study provides theoretical support for the coordinated evolution of digital innovation and highquality economic development and also provides a realistic basis for comprehensively grasping thecoordinated status of digital innovation and highquality economic development in various regionsand scientifically formulating differentiated development strategies.
